This is the first one!</p>\n<p><strong>A few things you should know upfront</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ghost is designed for ambitious, professional publishers who want to actively build a business around their content. Thatâ€™s who it works best for. </li>\n<li>The entire platform can be modified and customised to suit your needs. Itâ€™s very powerful, but does require some knowledge of code. Ghost is not necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a simple personal blog. </li>\n<li>For the best experience we recommend downloading the Ghost Desktop App for your computer, which is the best way to access your Ghost site on a desktop device. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ghost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost Foundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our Ghost(Pro) service, and every penny we make is re-invested into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern publishing.  </p>\n<p>The version of Ghost you are looking at right now would not have been made possible without generous contributions from the open source community.  </p>\n<h2>Next up, the editor</h2>\n<p>The main thing youâ€™ll want to read about next is probably: the Ghost editor. This is where the good stuff happens.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By the way, once youâ€™re done reading, you can simply delete the default <strong>Ghost</strong> user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts! </p>\n</blockquote>"}
