Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.","position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1,"offset":2},"end":{"line":3,"column":418,"offset":419},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1,"offset":2},"end":{"line":3,"column":418,"offset":419},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture.

To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult. We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1,"offset":691},"end":{"line":7,"column":791,"offset":1481},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1,"offset":691},"end":{"line":7,"column":791,"offset":1481},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically.
